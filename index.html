        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current sophomore college student at UC Riverside and I will be graduating in the summer of 2022. I was previously a Biochemistry major; however, I lost interest in such a degree because of multiple reasons, one being that I always had an admiration towards the business world and businessmen in particular. Because of my loss of interest, I decided to explore and switch into the Business major career path, the path I am in in  present time. Becoming a business student was a step I took fearfully, not only because I walked away from the Medical School route that I did not have an interest in, but also because a Business degree does not stand out as an admirable or unique; at least I have heard. Although I felt very intimidated in making this decision, I feel confident that it was made for a reason and it will allow to be a happier, dedicated, and more fulfilled individual in the long run.<br><br>

        Not only am I a current college student, but I also have a part time job at a Baskin Robbins/ Togo‚Äôs Restaurant.  I have had this job since the end of my junior year in high school, and I still hold it because of its comfortable commute from home, as well as the connections I have made there. Not only was this my first job, but it helped me get out of my comfort zone, allowing me to speak to strangers, in this case customers, more comfortably. I now deal with customers confidently, do not hesitate to project my voice to a group of people, and am able to make decisions confidently, although the decisions made at an ice cream/ sandwich shop may not be so major. As a very insecure individual prior to being hired at this job, not only have I learned that confidence is an important trait to have, but it has also shown me that I enjoy having management positions and would like to own my own businesses in the future, hence why I switched into Business. <br><br>

        From the research I have done, I plan on continuing my major in Business Administration and concentrating in Supply Chain Management. With this degree and concentration, I hope to receive a well-paying job in a global company that will allow me to travel and gain experience in the global market. With the experience and connections I will hopefully obtain, I hope to create my own global company that not only generated a great amount o revenue for myself, allowing me to live the life I have always dreamed of, but I hope to make it very influential and unique in a way that the masses will know of it no matter their country or location. Not only do I hope to make this achievement, but I also hope to master the concept of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù, meaning that I want to understand how to make excessive amounts of this valuable substance that the entire world revolves around efficiently and excessively.
